Import the RADseq data into a new directory (14_RADSeq_data)
Rename the fastq files using a rename script and a txt file just like before...
zip them up...

Create another basenames file in your main working directory...

Make a new directory (15_STACKS)

Run a Process_Radtags script in that directory, using a STACKS conda environment. 

Make a directory within it called "trimmed"

Run bbduk in a way that trims the 4 leftmost bp of each file and puts them in "trimmed". 

Rename everything in trimmed so it's less confusing. 

Now it's time to ALIGN!!!!!!
